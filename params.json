{"name":"Visualization Onboarding","tagline":"Towards Semi-Automated Generation of Visualization Onboarding for High-level Visualization Grammars","body":"This repository proposes a technical approach for the semi-automated creation of on-boarding elements for different visualization types and data sets. We demonstrate the approach using three well-known high-level descriptive visualization grammars ([Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/), and [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/)) to extract and describe visualization onboarding instructions and showthe feasibility by the example of a bar chart, a horizon graph, and a change matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
